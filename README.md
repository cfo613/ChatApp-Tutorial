# Chat App Tutorial

## About

This tutorial focuses on creating a chat application using JavaScript and WebSockets. It was a group effort with [Katrina Gardener] (https://github.com/katrinagardner) and [Alvin Liang] (https://github.com/Liangalvin).

Our tutorial admittedly has a bit of a snarky attitude, but it's all meant in good fun.

## My role

I specifically focused on the Client and Server portions of the tutorial.
